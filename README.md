# JOCLBLAS

JOCLBLAS - Java Bindings for clBLAS - http://jocl.org

This library is still under construction. 

An installation of [clBLAS](https://github.com/clMathLibraries/clBLAS/)
is required to build JOCLBLAS. Basic build instructions can be found in 
the [JOCL](https://github.com/gpu/JOCL) repository. Note the section
about **Building and packaging the external native library dependencies**
that describes how the dependency to the clBLAS library is handled.
